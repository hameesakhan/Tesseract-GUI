# Tesseract-GUI
This project provides a GUI for Tesseract installation

Note: This program uses a Tesseract-OCR installation.

You can add images to the program from the top main menu by two methods.
1) Directly from your scanner. (if it supports Windows Image Acquisition)
2) From an already stored file.

It works on temporary file so your files are safe.

Why was it needed?
I designed this program to reduce errors while reading text from image.

How it works?
1) Start program
2) From 'Settings' on the top menu, select 'Select Tesseract'. A Open Dialog will popup. Choose your 'Tesseract.exe' file in it.
Optional: 3) In 'Settings'-> 'Select Language', you can enter language code for your language.
4) From 'Main Menu', select your method of adding image to program and complete the process.
5) When the image has shown, you are ready to start creating rectangles on your required data in image.
6) Outputs will be saved in a file with name 'DataFile.exe' in the same directory as the executable file.

Note: Use arrow keys to navigate through your image.
